This project has 1 main goal to begin with:
* Take any events which I add as new notes to Evernote in the 'Events' notebook, and create corresponding google calender events, so that my calender stays synchronised even if I only interface with Evernote.

A secondary goal is to remind me how to code in python, as well as improve my knowledge on the infrastructure (unit testing frameworks, logging, schedulers, IDEs, packaging etc)

Setup process so far on Windows:
* Install python 2.7.10 32-bit
* Download evernote python SDK
* Run 'python setup.py install' to evernote SDK
* Pycurl has picked up the evernote modules/classes
